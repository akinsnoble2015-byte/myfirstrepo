      <b>HTML5 (Hypertext Markup Language 5)</b><span style="color: blue;"> is a markup language used for structuring</span> <br>
      and <span style="font-size: 100%; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; display: flex;"> hypertext documents on the World Wide Web. It was the fifth and final.</span><br>
      major version that is now a retired World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) <br>
      recommendation.<span id="Mee" >The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard</span>. It is<br>
      maintained by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), a<br>
      consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft).
</p>

<p>
  HTML5 was first released in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008,[2] with a major<br>
  update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014.[5][6] Its goals were to<br>
  improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; to<br>
  keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by<br>
  computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity<br>
  and to remain backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume<br>
  not only HTML 4 but also XHTML1 and even the DOM Level 2 HTML itself.[7]
</p>

<p>
  HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable<br>
  implementations; it extends, improves, and rationalizes the markup available for<br>
  documents and introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for<br>
  complex web applications.[8] For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a candidate for<br>
  cross-platform mobile applications because it includes features designed with low-powered devices in mind.
</p>

<p>
  Many new syntactic features are included. To natively include and handle multimedia<br>
  and graphical content, the new <video>, <audio> and <canvas> elements were<br>
  added; expandable sections are natively implemented through<br>
  <summary>...</summary> and <details>...</details> rather than depending<br>
  on CSS or JavaScript; and support for scalable vector graphics (SVG) content and<br>
  MathML for mathematical formulas was also added. To enrich the semantic content of<br>
  documents, new page structure elements such as <main>, <section></section><br>
  <article>, <header>, <footer>, <aside>, <nav>, and <figure> are added.<br>
  New attributes were introduced, some elements and attributes were removed, and<br>
  others such as <a>, <cite>, and <menu> were changed, redefined, or standardized.<br>
  The APIs and Document Object Model (DOM) are now fundamental parts of the HTML5 specification,[8]<br>
  and HTML5 also better defines the processing for any invalid documents.[9]
